Thank you for downloading the SecretBlaze Standard Version.


                         GETTING STARTED 

The xil_run.sh file provides useful script commands of the SecretBlaze
platform for Xilinx's tools. ISE and EDK must be installed on your computer.
Before running the xil_run.sh file, you must check the installation directory
path. The variable can be edited at the beginning of the script.

Example:
YOUR_LIN_XIL_TOOL_PATH=/opt/Xilinx/14.1/ISE_DS

To start the script:
./xil_run.sh

Nota: Windows/Cygwin systems are no longer supported (since EDK 13.1)


                           SOC CONFIG 

See the config_lib/*****.vhd files for the general configuration
of the SecretBlaze-based SoC. Advanced hardware settings can be easily 
modified by editing several package files. If you do so, don't 
forget to update software drivers, linker files, and/or compiler 
options.
